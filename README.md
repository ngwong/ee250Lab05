Lab 05 Repository for Test Suite

The five test cases are as follows:
1. Blink the LED 5 times with on/off intervals of 500ms.
2. For about 5 seconds, read the output of the Grove light sensor with intervals of 100 ms and print the raw value along with      the text “bright” or “dark” (you will have to determine a threshold for this through experimentation) .
3. Blink the LED 4 times with on/off intervals of 200ms.
4. For about 5 seconds, read the output of the Grove sound sensor with intervals of 100 ms and print the raw value. If the        sound sensor is tapped (i.e. the sound magnitude goes above the threshold you decide from experimentation), the LED should      turn on for 100 ms. Think about how to design your while loop so this section of the test does not surpass 5 seconds.
5. Blink the LED 4 times with on/off intervals of 200ms.
